Disclaimer: I started this project because I wanted to see what my favorite songs would sound like in various different concert halls, venues, stadiums, etc. This is purely an exploratory project and is by no means comprehensive.

## Background
Indoor music venues can be thought of as Linear and Time Invariant (LTI) systems. LTI systems have 2 defining properties:
* Linearity: There is a linear mapping between the input and output

* Time Invariance: Delaying an input by T delays the output by T
